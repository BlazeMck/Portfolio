    <h1>Riley Blaze McKinlay</h1>
    <h3>Davis Technical College Graduate</h3>
    <h4>Early Life - Motivation</h4>
    <p>
       Born on a Navy Base in Jacksonville, Florida to Dugan and Amber McKinlay in June of 2003 I never was one to sit in one place, and neither was my family.
       Almost every year we moved to a new apartment, a new city, and occasionally a new state. Eventually, after my father remarried, we had settled down in North Salt Lake, Utah.
       I attended Woods Cross High School for a total of 3 years, as the Davis School District didn't have a freshman year. It was here that I discovered a knack for computers,
       I would ask for one very year for my birthday and, eventually, I got one. An old office computer still running Windows XP, certainly not the most powerful option on the market,
       but it was mine. My uncle suggested that I 'Frankenstein' it into something more powerful, and I took him up on that. I learned how components connected, how to determine compatibility,
       the differences between the major companies, such as AMD and Intel. I had gained a thirst for knowledge when it came to computers early on, and I took almost any chance I could to learn more.
    </p>
    <h4>High School - Woods Cross High School</h4>
    <p>
       During my Junior year I attended a computer programming course, and was immediately enamoured. Mr. Snelson had opted to teach us Java, I learned the basics of development, how different 
       data types are stored, conditionals, and loops. I had wished to do more than just the basics, but unfortunately the continuation of that course didn't receive enough sign-ups, and the class 
       was dropped before I received the chance. After that first semester I knew that I wanted to be a software engineer and I wasn't going to let myself be held back by the lack of this course at Woods Cross High.
       I enrolled into three courses simultaneously my senior year that would allow me to explore other aspects of software development. Web Development, Game Development Fundamentals, and a joint enrollment with 
       Davis Technical College (DTC). The most notable of which was my joint enrollment with DTC, although I did learn plenty from my time in both Web Development and Game Development Fundamentals,
       graduating with Straight A's in every course pertaining to software development.
    </p>
    <h4>Information Technology - Davis Technical College</h4>
    <p>
        My joint enrollment in DTC was in their Information Technology program, where I learned the process of troubleshooting and fixing problems on computers within a business setting.
        The classes taught at the DTC typically would include extensive labs and hands-on training for problems that would be encountered while working in the field. I learned linux, networking, servers,
        troubleshooting, ticket systems, virtual machines, printers, and so much more. By the end of the course I participated in many exams, such as Microsoft Networking, CompTIA ITF, and CompTIA A+,
        passing all of them and gaining myself certifications in those fields. Although a fantastic learning experience, 
        Information Technology wasn't my ultimate goal, it was a stepping stone and a requirement for the Software Development program offered at DTC. After a small break and coming back to complete the Information Technology 
        program I soon set my sights on completing the Software Development program within the year.<br>

    <h4>Software Development - Davis Technical College</h4>
    <p>
        I enrolled in the Software Development program in January of 2025 with one goal in mind, complete the program within a year, ahead of the typical expected schedule, and find my career within Software Development
        with the skills that DTC would ingrain within me. This goal was bolstered by the fact that I had been married the October prior, to one Reagan McKinlay, and wanted to give us a wonderful married life.
        During my time at the DTC I would create a myriad of different programs and solutions for theoretical problems thrown my way. I learned how to code in many different languages, such as HTML, CSS, PHP,
        JavaScript, React Native, MySQL, and C#. I also learned skills that would translate to multiple different programming disciplines, such as version control via Git, CI/CD pipelines in Azure, Unit Testing, and the use of 
        relational databases in many aspects. Ultimately the largest takeaway I have from the Software Development program is the ability to learn quickly. Although I've never worked with programming languages such as Python
        or Ruby I am positive that I could learn them quickly. One of my largest achievements walking away from the program is my speed, completing it 3 months ahead of schedule. But that isn't the only thing I'm proud of.
        During my time at Davis Technical College generative AI tools such as Chat-GPT, Gemini, Claude, and CoPilot were starting to really take off, and people started to incorporate those tools into their programming. However,
        there is always too much of a good thing and those generative AI tools gave way to a new kind of programming, vibe-coding. To clear any air, I am rather against leaning on AI generative tools so heavily, I attempted using
        them on occasion, but would find that they gave me mixed messages, incorrect logic, or downright awful code more often than not. I am happy to say that the knowledge I take away from DTC's Software Development program is my own,
        and not the product of me using AI tools to do my work for me. And with my own skills and knowledge I graduated with a 3.93 GPA. Any code showcased within this e-portfolio is mine and only mine.<br>
